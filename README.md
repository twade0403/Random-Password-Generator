# Random-Password-Generator
 
 With this project I used a lot of the knowledge that has been given throughout the class along with information I found through trial and error.
 
 In order to improve with JavaScript you need to be prepared to fail, this is something I learned when making the password generator.
 
 I also learned that I need to use all the resources I can get my hands on, if at first something doesn't work use everthing you have learned and also use google to find what others have learned and shared.
